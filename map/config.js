In New York City alone, xx restaurants have shut their doors. To explore and visualize the impact of the pandemic on the economic life of the city we <a href="" target="_blank">scraped</a> the <a href="https://labor.ny.gov/app/warn/default.asp" target="_blank">Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN)</a> data for 2019 and 2020, and <a href="" target="_blank">geocoded</a> its results.</p><p>The Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification Act of 1988 requires all businesses with 100 or more employees to submit a 60-day advance notification of plant closings or mass layoffs. However, in the case of "unforeseeable business circumstances", such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 60-day advance period can be waived. Nevertheless, this dataset can help us grasp the extent and range of economic devastation brought on by the pandemic.</p><p>Note that in New York State only businesses with 50 or more employees are required to submit WARN notices, and therefore this data cannot account for the hundreds of small businesses affected by the pandemic.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Scroll to continue<br>â–¼</p>',
